# Java Library Management Application

Java Library Management Application is a simple program that allows users to manage book and borrowing data in a library. This program is written in the Java programming language.

## Features

- **Input Data Items**: Users can input item data into the system, including title, edition, total quantity, borrowed quantity, available quantity, damaged quantity, and publisher.
- **Input Borrowing Data**: Users can input book borrowing data into the system, including book title, borrowing date, borrower's name, return date, and quantity borrowed.
- **Items Report**: The program will generate a report of items that includes all items entered by the user. This report will be saved in the `Items.txt` file.
- **Borrowing Report**: The program will also generate a borrowing book report that includes all borrowing transactions entered by the user. This report will be saved in the `Borrowers.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to `Perpustakaan.java` and run it within VSCode or a similar IDE.
2. Input the required data according to its type, such as integers for numerical values and strings for textual data.
3. Ensure the correct data input to avoid the code being "Terminated forcefully" or "data will not be entered into the TXT".
4. Once you finish inputting the data, it will be saved to a `.txt` file for storage.
